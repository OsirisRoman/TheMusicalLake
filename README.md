# The Musical Lake

_One day, an explorer started following some strange sounds, he then arrived at a lake where he found the source: 3 little animals doing music-like-sounds.

A short time passed, and the explorer was able to differentiate which animal produced which sound.._

###### Sound

    _ **Frog:** brr, birip, brrah, croac
    _ **Dragonfly:** fiu, plop, pep 
    _ **Criket:** cric-cric, trri-trri, bri-bri

_After a while he discovered that they where "singing" together. Whenever the frog started with brr, the dragonfly responded to his sound rubbing its tail with a branch producing a sound as fiu, after the dragonfly, the criket continued with cric-cric but, everytime the frog sounded as brrah or croac all animals would mute for a while, and then they continued all over again. Before the sky was dark the explorer was able to write 3 "songs" they all did together and came up with these notes._

###### Songs

    _ **#1:** brr, fiu, cric-cric, brrah
    _ **#2:** pep, birip, trri-trri, croac 
    _ **#3:** bri-bri, plop, cric-cric, brrah

###### Exercise

_write a program that lets you receive a given sound from the list of sounds each animal does and returns the remaining sounds of any of the 3 songs that the explorer wrote e.g.:_

    * When given brr it should reproduce fiu, cric-cric, brrah according to the first song.
    * When given birip it should reproduce trri-trri, croac according to the second song.
    * When given plop it should reproduce cric-cric, brrah according to the third song.
    * When given croac or brrah it shouldn't reproduce anything according to all songs.
