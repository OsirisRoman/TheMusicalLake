# The Musical Lake

One day, an explorer started following some strange sounds, he then arrived at a lake where he found the source: 3 little animals doing music-like-sounds.

A short time passed, and the explorer was able to differentiate which animal produced which sound..

###### Sound

   * **Frog:** brr, birip, brrah, croac
   * **Dragonfly:** fiu, plop, pep 
   * **Criket:** cric-cric, trri-trri, bri-bri

After a while he discovered that they where "singing" together. Whenever the frog started with brr, the dragonfly responded to his sound rubbing its tail with a branch producing a sound as fiu, after the dragonfly, the criket continued with cric-cric but, everytime the frog sounded as brrah or croac all animals would mute for a while, and then they continued all over again. Before the sky was dark the explorer was able to write 3 "songs" they all did together and came up with these notes.

###### Songs

   * **#1:** brr, fiu, cric-cric, brrah
   * **#2:** pep, birip, trri-trri, croac 
   * **#3:** bri-bri, plop, cric-cric, brrah

###### Exercise

Write a program that lets you receive a given sound from the list of sounds each animal does and returns the remaining sounds of any of the 3 songs that the explorer wrote e.g.:

   * When given brr it should reproduce fiu, cric-cric, brrah according to the first song.
   * When given birip it should reproduce trri-trri, croac according to the second song.
   * When given plop it should reproduce cric-cric, brrah according to the third song.
   * When given croac or brrah it shouldn't reproduce anything according to all songs.
